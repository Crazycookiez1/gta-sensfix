#gta-sensfix
This is an utility that patches 3D GTA games sens, fixing the Y axis and just general quality of life enhancements. One would say I reinvented the wheel, but nobody got this right at all.

This is a GUI through which you can properly configure sensitivity, enable or disable sensitivity fix and other features. All your preferences will be saved in User Files as "sens.set".
