# gtasa-sensitivity-enhance
This is an utility that patches Grand Theft Auto San Andreas sensitivity, fixes the Y axis and makes it smooth. Due to the lack of proper sensitivity fixes, I've decided to make one by myself. 


This is a GUI through which you can properly configure sensitivity, enable or disable sensitivity fix and other features. All your preferences will be saved in User Files
as "sens.set". Deleting it will break the sensitivity fix and you will have to do it all over again.
